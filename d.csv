review
I don’t even know where to start, because almost everything in this movie is bad. The plot is ridiculous even for a Russian comedy, the actors play their roles at the level of a performance in the 6B grade. The characters have changed little in comparison with the first part - they are still pathologically drunk, shameless. The heroes of this comedy without hesitation betray each other and create outrages and destruction around themselves. It seems that those people who prescribed the character of the characters in the film simply took the worst of the vices of the unfortunate Russian man in the street. How does a movie like this collect cash? The audience of such comedies fills cinema halls not for the sake of high-quality humor, good directorial work, or at least just normal acting, no. They come to look at themselves in order to feel this moment of irony: 'look, in the comedy there are the same half-drunk and boorish misanthropes. It's funny!' BUT, in this movie there is not and cannot be anything funny, this is not a comedy, this is reaching the bottom. I sincerely sympathize with the people who gave this 'movie' a rating above five stars;/
Tarantino is an ambiguous person. In general, making a hit film with a cool plot and sharp, possibly sharp black humor is not an easy task. Tarantino can. Firstly, this is already the 3rd serious work of Quentin. After 'Reservoir Dogs' with a constellation of actors, 'Pulp Fiction' consists of the same, BUT: everything is more complicated and interesting here. The plot is not simple and banal. The plot is well done. Here's the trademark Tarantino's 'torn' narrative, jumping from one part to another, returning to the previous one - intriguing. You sit on pins and needles, after watching one episode first, then you want a sequel - but no. If there is something at the beginning of the film, it will be revealed only at the end. The humor in the film, though dark, is excellent. Sitting on pins and needles, laughing - this is what the viewer needs. The music in the film is, as always, in a Tarantino way. The music of the past years, the one that is still on the records that gather dust in the closet. Constellation of actors. All the actors chosen in the film correspond to their usual characters: - John Travolta, who constantly plays the bad guys. - Samuel L. Jackson, who plays the 'good bad' noble villains. - Bruce 'Die Hard' Willis, who is inherent in the role of a depressive, who is seriously fed up with life. - Harvey Keitel, although he was in the film for a little time, but how he played ... - Quentin Tarantino, director, screenwriter, who played the squeamish owner of the house, to whom a dead African American was brought. - A separate word about Uma Thurman. Uma Thurman looks different in all roles and situations, beautiful ... What, in general, to say about the film, this is only one thing: 10 out of 10/
A wonderful story about how not to lose yourself, your loved ones and friends, even if unimaginable changes have taken place in your life. The protagonist Peter Parker lives with his uncle and aunt, is secretly in love with his neighbor, has simply amazing academic success and has decided on his future profession as a photographer. It seems that everything in life is in its place, but fate presents him with a gift in the form of an impudent spider that bites Peter on a school trip and changes his life forever. So he becomes a superhero who is always ready to help ordinary people in trouble. But not everything goes as well as we would like. The father of Peter's best friend - Gary Osborn, unsuccessfully conducts experiments on himself and unwittingly becomes the main enemy of Spider-Man! An unsolvable situation becomes before Peter: how to save the city from the Green Goblin and at the same time not harm the father of his best friend? The amazing performance of Tobey Maguire makes us believe in Peter: how to learn to control your feelings, how hard it is to lose loved ones, especially through your own fault, how difficult it is to make a choice between good and evil, duty and friendship, truth and lies. But our hero does not give up, because he believes in himself and in his strength, and knows what all the people who live in his hometown need. Movies based on superhero comics are my favorite. Now they include Spider-Man, a superhero who knows that 'the greater the power, the greater the responsibility'./
Taika Waititi was relentless and threw in so much 'humor' that it feels like it's not a new MCU project, but someone's stand-up. It’s a pity that it’s unsuccessful, since there are practically no really funny and relevant jokes. If you disassemble the script, it looks more like an amateur essay than the work of a professional screenwriter. The movie features: Thor; Gorr; Guardians of the Galaxy; Jane; children of Asgard; Korg; screaming goats and even Zeus, and yet almost every one of them feels like a background character. Something is constantly happening on the screen, but all this bright and colorful action is devoid of any depth and meaning. There is drama, but it looks sluggish (especially against the backdrop of inappropriate and frequent puns). The action is not impressive and does not capture the spirit, because you do not have time to feel the antagonist. The result is a tattered, empty, and one of the worst films in the MCU.
